	Instructions for using Geomview's `configure' script

Geomview uses the GNU autoconf configuration system.  The way to
configure and compile Geomview is the same as with any piece of
GNU-style software:

	./configure
	make
	make install

Once `make' completes you can run Geomview without doing `make install'
by running the script `geomview' in the top-level directory.  In
order for this to work you'll need to be in that directory.

The `reconf' script in the top-level directory will regenerate the
`configure' script, using autoreconf, part of the autoconf system.
This is useful if no useful `configure' script is already present,
which is normal only for copies of Geomview that have been taken
directly from developer CVS. See the `README.cvs' textfile for hints
on building Geomview from developer CVS.

The default installation prefix for Geomview is no longer
`/usr/local/Geomview/', but just `/usr/local/'. The directory layout
below the prefix follows the conventions of any other GNU package:
binaries below `PREFIX/bin/', data below `PREFIX/share/geomview/',
executable code below `PREFIX/libexec/geomview/' (here live the
modules). The documentation is installed below
`PREFIX/share/doc/geomview-VERSION/'. See the file `INSTALL' for
generic installation instructions.

Geomview requires Motif and benefits from OpenGL; you need to make
sure Motif is installed on your system before you can compile (or run)
Geomview.  Both of these are commercial software packages but Geomview
will also work with their free counterparts Lesstif or OpenMotif
(www.lesstif.org or www.openmotif.org) and Mesa (www.mesa3d.org) [But
Linux users see the comments in the 'Linux' section below about
Lesstif/OpenMotif.]  If either of these is installed on your system in
a directory that your compiler doesn't look in by default, you can use
the following options to Geomview's configure script to tell Geomview
where to find them:

	--with-opengl=DIR
	    You can use this option if the OpenGL header files and
	    libraries on your system are installed in some place that
	    your compiler doesn't recognize by default.  This option
	    specifies that OpenGL (or Mesa) is installed on your
	    system in the directory DIR.  DIR should have a
	    subdirectory called `include' which has the GL header
	    files, and a subdirectory called `lib' which has the
	    library files in it.  You don't need this option if your
	    compiler can find the OpenGL header files and libraries in
	    the standard places that it looks.  If you're not sure
	    about this option, try configuring without it.
	    'configure' will abort with an error if your compiler
	    can't find the appropriate header files and libraries.
            You can use `--without-opengl' or `--with-opengl=no' to
            disable the use of OpenGL.

	--with-motif=DIR
	    You can use this option if the Motif header files and
	    libraries on your system are installed in some place that
	    your compiler doesn't recognize by default.  This option
	    specifies that Motif is installed on your system in the
	    directory DIR.  DIR should have a subdirectory called
	    `include' which has the Motif header files, and a
	    subdirectory called `lib' which has the library files in
	    it.  You don't need this option if your compiler can find
	    the Motif header files and libraries in the standard
	    places that it looks.  If you're not sure about this
	    option, try configuring without it.  'configure' will
	    abort with an error if your compiler can't find the
	    appropriate header files and libraries.

You can use evironment variables to override various default settings
in 'configure' (such as which compiler to use and which options to
pass to it).  There are many such variables that are generic to all
GNU autoconf 'configure' scripts; see the file INSTALL for details on
this.  In addition to these generic settings, the following
variables are specific to Geomview:

	MOTIFLIBS
	    '-l' options to pass to the linker for linking with the
	    Motif libaraies.  Defaults to "-lXm", but some versions of
	    Motif apparently need additional libararies, such as
	    '-lXp'.  To specify this, do
		MOTIFLIBS='-lXm -lXp' ./configure
	    Note that MOTIFLIBS should NOT include any -L options to
	    specify the location of the libraries; use the
	    --with-motif configure argument for that.  The MOTIFLIBS
	    variable is just for specifying the list of libraries
	    themselves.

PLATFORM SPECIFIC NOTES:

Up-to-date instructions can also be accessed through the Geomview
web-pages at

LinuxPPC
--------

On at least one LinuxPPC system with MetroX it was necessary to
specify -lXp when linking with the Motif libraries
("MOTIFLIBS='-lXm -lXp' ./configure").


Solaris
-------

On the Solaris 2.6 system that I tested, the 'example' external module
in 'src/bin/example' failed to link because of an error of the form
    ld: warning: relocation error: R_SPARC_32: file main.o: symbol .LLC1:
	external symbolic relocation against non-allocatable section .stab;
	cannot be processed at runtime: relocation ignored
    Undefined                       first referenced
     symbol                             in file
    .LLC1                               main.o
This was when using GNU gcc to compile and Sun's ld to link, and I
believe this error may be due to an incompatibility between these two
programs, or at least the versions that were on this system.  If
this happens to you, you can build with "make -k" to force "make" to
continue building the rest of the distribution in spite of this error.
The only thing you'll be missing is this one external module, which
isn't necessary for Geomview itself.  If you find a way to fix this
problem, let me [mbp@geomtech.com] know.


IRIX
----

Older IRIX systems may require compiling with -XSVR4.  This flag
had disappeared by IRIX 5.3, so you're unlikely to run into this.

On the IRIX 6.3 system that I tested (using CC=cc), the linker crashed
when trying to link several of the external modules.  I suspect it may
be due to a broken compiler installation on that particular machine,
but I'm not sure.  I'll try to get access to a more recent IRIX
installation soon and will check it out more.  In the meantime, if you
compile Geomview on IRIX and run into any problems, please let me
[mbp@geomtech.com] know.

Cygwin and various older Unix-like system
-----------------------------------------

Nowadays Xorg installs itself using the usual directory layout below a
PREFIX path, just like many other GNU packages. Former version
installed themselves below PFX/X11R<VERSION> (e.g. /usr/X11R6). In
this case, the following switches are needed:

./configure --with-motif=/usr/X11R6 --with-opengl=/usr/X11R6 OTHERSWICHES


Mac OS X
--------

Reported by Raphael Straub:

X11 (on the Mac OS X Install DVD) and the X11SDK (part of the Xcode
Developer Tools) must be installed before Geomview can be
compiled. OpenMotif or Lesstif can be manually compiled from source or
installed with a package manager like Fink (http://www.finkproject.org/)
or MacPorts (http://www.macports.org/). Both package managers also provide
their own Geomview package.

On Mac OS X 10.5 please execute the following line before running
configure (see: http://developer.apple.com/qa/qa2007/qa1567.html)

export LDFLAGS="-dylib_file \
  /System/Library/Frameworks/OpenGL.framework/Versions/A/Libraries/libGL.dylib:\
/System/Library/Frameworks/OpenGL.framework/Versions/A/Libraries/libGL.dylib"

In most cases Geomview can be configured with

./configure --with-opengl=/usr/X11R6 --with-htmlbrowser=open \
  --with-pdfviewer=open \
  --with-motif=/path/to/your/motif/installation

This enables OpenGL support and uses your default HTML browser and PDF
viewer for viewing the Geomview documentation.
