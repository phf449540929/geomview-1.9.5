1.9.5 March 2014

   * vastly extended lisp-interpreter, including lambda-expression, defun,
     let, while, setq, eval

   * `(process-events)' lisp function to branch out of a command-script
     and temporarily give the control back to the main command-loop

   * Proper handling of quoted input tokens: those cannot serve as
     function or variable names

   * other bug-fixes (notably: multi-object geometry-only files work again)

   * memory allocation fixes

   * compilation and build fixes

1.9.4 August 2007

   * Translation of the manual to Brazilian Portuguese, courtesy of
     Jorge Barros de Abreu <ficmatin10@solar.com.br>.

   * Image-stream filter bug fixes.

   * Fixed (transform ...), (transform-incr ...) interests (broken by
     previous change since 1.9.0)

   * Improved computation of averaged per-vertex polygon normals
     (taking the relative orientation of the facets in to account).

   * Loading of textured meshes was broken by a previous change since
     1.9.0, fix that.

   * GEOMROOT environment variable has been resurrected, needed by
     some external modules (e.g. StageTools).

1.9.3 June 2007

   * Drawing of spheres was severely broken.

1.9.2 June 2007

   * Bug-fix release for 1.9.0 (see ChangeLog)

   * ND-picking was not fully implemented; should work now

   * PICKFUNC() interface has changed

1.9.1 May 2007

   * Bug-fix release for 1.9.0

   * versions strings were wrong in some places

   * textures would not be reloaded after deleting all cameras (OpenGL
     MG-backend)

1.9.0 April 2007

   * the OpenGL `MG' back-end is now able to display translucent
     object _correctly_. More specifically: translucency will be
     displayed correctly for each separate top-level object (those
     which appear in the object browser). Different translucent
     top-level objects will not be rendered correctly w.r.t. to each
     other. Translucency also works for non-flat or concave polygons
     if the Geomview is configured for OpenGL and if libGLU is found;
     in that case the GLU tesselator is used to compute a
     triangulation of concave or even self-intersecting polygons.

   * new GCL object: Image. Image data for textures or background can
     now be embedded into the ordinary GCL data stream. Images can be
     given symbolic names via (read image { define ... }) and
     (hdefine...).

   * Appearances can now be given symbolic names via `define' and `hdefine'

   * RenderMan output now supports texturing. I had to write some more
     shaders to support this. The new shaders do not seem to work with
     the old BMRT (Blue Moon Render Tools) package, because BMRT does
     not seem to understand the `textureinfo' command. More recent
     renderers like Aqsis, 3Delight and Pixie seem to work. Also, writing
     bianry RIB files was broken on Big-Endian machines in all previous
     releases of Geomview.

   * Textures can be applied in "replace" mode: the texture colour
     simply replaces the surface color.

   * support for translucent textures

   * The Sphere OOGL objects now have support for texture-xmapping; the
     details are documented in the Geomview manual.

   * new GCL command `hdelete' (lazy deletion of global handles)

   * new GCL commands (dump-handles) and (write-handle FILENAME) to aid
     debugging

   * All emodules which need the XForms library have been moved to the
     separate package `gvemodules-xforms', the `ndutils', `NDview',
     `Crayola' and `Labeler' emodules have been moved to separate packages.

   * External extension modules ("emodules") no longer neeed to be
     compiled inside the Geomview source-tree; they can now be built
     separately, using an installed version of the OOGL library and
     the header files. Compiling external add-ons inside the source
     tree is no longer supported. I have ported `Maniview' and the
     `Orrery' to this new scheme.

   * another bunch of internal fixes, most notably fixing of reference
     counts

   * The manual now has cross-references for individual GCL commands.

1.8.2 November 2006 (never released)

   * I/O with release <= 1.8.1 was just broken, they used internals of
     opaque data-types (e.g. the FILE handle of the stdio library)
   * Maple V8 interface
   * VRML2 interface
   * build-system fixes (ported to recent automake/autoconf combo)
   * standard GNU installation paths: PREFIX/bin, PREFIX/share/geomview,
     PREFIX/libexec/geomview etc.
   * variable argument fixes, was also broken in <= 1.8.1 releases.
   * Documentation can be regenerated with recent texinfo releases.
   * OpenGL is now optional
   * one big shared libgeomview library
   * fmemopen() by using temporary files (not using stdio internals)
   * I have resurrected a couple of old modules: NDview, clipboard,
     cplxview, crayola, flythrough, gvclock, hinge, labeler, ndutils.
   * New "BBox Center" toggle in the tools menu (use the center of the
     current object's bouding box for the CENTER object)
   * optionally use the window-manager's idea of the focus for the camera
     windows instead of forcing a mouse-cross policy -- new GCL function
     (ui-cam-focus [focus-change|mouse-cross])
   * Fixed a couple (Ups!) of long-standing memory leaks.

   * The Nd code in Geomview was one big ugly memory leak. Fixed that.
   * ND transformations and vectors now have their homogeneous component
     at index 0.
   * It is now possible to define handles for "ntransform" objects, i.e.
     "(read ntransfrom { define fred ... })" works now.
   * Each camera of a cluster now has it's (additional) private 3d transform,
     the focal-length hack has gone.
   * The look commands work now in the context of ND-viewing.
   * Basic INST support for ND transformations.
   * Picking works now with ND-viewing.

1.8.1	March, 2001

   This is a bugfix release.

   * No segfaults at startup on linux.
   * Toggle buttons are visible again.
   * Binary I/O on linux works.

1.8.0   November 17, 2000

   The software in this release is almost the same as in the 1.7.*
   series. The main difference is that it has an improved configure
   script and Makefiles that allow for several new things.

   (a) VPATH builds now supported

   (b) Additional external modules can simply be dropped into place in
       the "src/bin" directory, and Geomview's configure script will
       notice their presence and configure/build them when you
       configure/build Geomview.  (This only works with module
       distributions that have been specifically packed up for this
       purpose; see http://www.geomview.org/download for more
       details.)

   (c) The binary Intel/Linux XFORMS distribution is no longer a part
       of the Geomview source distribution.  Users who want it can
       download it separately, unpack it into the Geomview source
       tree, and Geomview's configure script will notice it's there
       and use it.  (This works with the binary XFORMS distribution
       for any system, not just Intel/Linux.)

   (d) 'togeomview' program now included in the release (this program,
       used to facilitate communication between Geomview and other
       programs, got temporarily dropped in release 1.7.0, but now is
       back).

   (e) a few minor bug fixes; see ChangeLog for details


1.7.10  Nov 1, 2000

   Attempted to fix bug which caused Geomview to crash immediately
   upon startup on some newer GNU/Linux systems.  The bug has to do
   with Geomview's use of the 'fmemopen' system function.  This
   release attempts to autodetect which version of this function to
   use.  If it still crashes for you, pass the flag
   "--enable-fstropen-1" to "configure" and try again.  If you still
   have problems, let me [mbp@geomtech.com] know.

   Misc fixes to allow compilation on wider variety of platforms


1.7.9  Oct 20, 2000

   Minor change to allow compilation with Mesa-3.3 (related to how
   Mesa-3.3 declares prototypes for GL extention functions).  No
   change in functionality, but this version compiles without errors
   with Mesa-3.3, which previous versions didn't.

1.7.8  Oct 14, 2000     

   Fixed bug which prevented compressed textures from working on
   some Linux systems
        
   Fixed several compilation/configuration problems.  Now tested on:
       Linux:  RedHat 6.1, 7.0
	       Mandrake 7.0
	       Caldera-2.3
	       Mandrake-7.0
	       Slackware-7.0
       Solaris-2.6 (SunOS 5.6)
       AIX 4.3.2
       IRIX 6.3



1.7.7   August 22, 2000

   Added some of the external modules to the distribution, but haven't
   actually tested them.  Updated the documentation to reflect the
   fact that the geomview-users mailing list is now hosted at
   lists.sourceforge.net.

1.7.6   May 25, 2000

   This is the first release of Geomview to use GNU autoconf.  The
   autoconf script has been tested on Linux (RedHat 6.1), IRIX 6.3,
   and AIX 4.3.2.  It's untested on other platforms and may need
   tweaking to work on them.  Also, note that this release does not
   include the external modules.  If you want any of them, use an
   older release, or wait for a future one.
