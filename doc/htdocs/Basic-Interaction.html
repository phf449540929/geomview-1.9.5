<h3 class="section">3.3 Basic Interaction: The Main Panel</h3>

<p>Normally when you invoke Geomview, three windows appear: the
<em>Main</em> panel, the <em>Tools</em> panel, and one camera window. 
Geomview has many other windows but most things can be done with these
three and so by default the others do not appear.  This section of the
manual introduces some basic concepts that are used throughout the rest
of the manual and describes the <em>Main</em> panel.

Geomview can display an arbitrary number of objects simultaneously.  The
<em>Targets</em> browser in the <em>Main</em> panel displays a list of all
the objects that Geomview currently knows about.  This browser has a
line for each object that you have loaded, plus some lines for other
objects.  One of the other objects is called <code>World</code> and corresponds to
the all the currently loaded objects, treated as if they were one
object.  Most of the operations that you can do to one object, such as
applying a motion or changing a color, can also be done to the "World"
object.

   <p>The <em>Targets</em> browser also has an entry for each camera.  By
default there is only one camera; it is possible to add more of them via
the <em>New Camera</em> entry of the <em>Main</em> panel's <em>File</em> menu. 
Geomview treats cameras in much the same way
as it does geometric objects.  For example, you can move cameras around
and add them and delete them just as with geometric objects.  Cameras do
not usually show up in the display as an object that you see.  Each
camera has a separate camera window which displays the view as seen by
that camera.  (It is possible for each camera to display a geometric
representation of other cameras.  See <a href="Cameras.html#Cameras">Cameras</a>.)

   <p>Because Geomview treats cameras and geometric objects very similarly,
the term <dfn>object</dfn> in this documentation is used to refer to either
one.  When we need to distinguish between the two kinds of objects, we
use the term <dfn>geom</dfn> to denote a geometric object and the word
<dfn>camera</dfn> to denote a camera.

   <p>The object which is selected (highlighted) in the <em>Targets</em>
browser is called the <dfn>target</dfn> object.  This is the object that
receives any actions that you do with the mouse or keyboard.  You can
change the target object by selecting a different line in the
<em>Targets</em> browser.  Another way to change the target object is
to put the mouse cursor directly over a geometry in a camera window
and rapidly double-click the right mouse button.  This process is called
<dfn>picking</dfn>; the picked object becomes the new target.

   <p>Geomview objects are all known by two names, both of which are shown in
the <em>Targets</em> browser.  The first name given there, which appears
in square brackets ([ ]), is a short name assigned by Geomview when you
load the object.  It consists of the letter `g' for geometries and `c' for
cameras, followed by a number.  The second name is a longer more
descriptive name; by default this is the name of the file that the
object was loaded from.  The two names are equivalent as far as Geomview
is concerned; at any point where you need to specify a name you can give
either one.

   <p>To manipulate an object, make sure you that the object you want to move is the
target object, and put the mouse cursor in a camera window.  Motions are
applied by holding down either the left or middle mouse button and
moving the mouse.  There are several different motion "modes", each for
applying a different kind of motion.  The <em>MOTION MODE</em> browser
in the <em>Main</em> panel indicates the current motion mode.  The
default is "Rotate".  You can change the current motion mode by
selecting a new one in the <em>MOTION MODE</em> browser, or by using the
<em>Tools</em> panel.  For more information about motion modes,
See <a href="Mouse-Motions.html#Mouse-Motions">Mouse Motions</a>.

   <p>The <em>Modules</em> browser lists Geomview external modules.  An
external module is a separate program that interacts with Geomview to
extend its functionality.  For information on external modules,
See <a href="Modules.html#Modules">Modules</a>.

   <p>The menu bar at the top of the main panel offers menus for common operations.

   <p>To create new windows, load new objects, save objects or other information,
or quit from geomview, see the <em>File</em> menu.

   <p>To copy or delete objects, see the <em>Edit</em> menu.

   <p>You can invoke any panel from the <em>Inspect</em> menu.

   <p>The <em>Space</em> menu lets you choose whether geomview operates
in Euclidean, Hyperbolic, or Spherical mode.  Euclidean mode is selected
by default.  For details about using <em>Hyperbolic</em> and
<em>Spherical</em> spaces, See <a href="Non_002dEuclidean-Geometry.html#Non_002dEuclidean-Geometry">Non-Euclidean Geometry</a>.

   <p>Most actions that you can do through Geomview's panels have equivalent
keyboard shortcuts so that you can do the same action by typing a
sequence of keys on the keyboard.  This is useful for advanced users who
are familiar with Geomview's capabilities and want to work quickly
without having to have lots of panels cluttering up the screen. 
Keyboard shortcuts are usually indicated in square brackets ([ ]) near
the corresponding item in a panel.  For example, the keyboard shortcut
for <em>Rotate</em> mode is 'r'; this is indicated by "[r]" appearing
before the word "Rotate" in the <em>MOTION MODE</em> browser.  To
use this keyboard shortcut, just hit the <kbd>r</kbd> key while the mouse
cursor is in any Geomview window.  Do not hit the <kbd>&lt;Enter&gt;</kbd> key
afterwards.

   <p>Some keyboard shortcuts consist of more than one key.  In these cases
just type the keys one after the other, with no <kbd>&lt;Enter&gt;</kbd>
afterwards.  Keyboard shortcuts are case sensitive.

   <p>Many keyboard shortcuts can be preceded by a numeric parameter. 
For example, typing <code>ae</code> toggles the state of drawing edges,
while <code>1ae</code> always enables edge drawing.

   <p>The <em>keyboard</em> field in the upper left corner of the <em>Main</em>
panel echos the current state of keyboard shortcuts.

   <p>For a list of all keyboard shortcuts, press the <code>?</code> key.
