<h4 class="subsection">4.1.11 Texture Mapping</h4>

<p>Some rendering back-ends support texture-mapped objects, actually only
the OpenGL and the RenderMan interface at the time of this
writing. There are also some issues with the RMan interface when using
an alpha-channel in the texture image. Those rendering back-ends which
don't support texturing silently ignore attempts to use texture
mapping. A texture is specified as part of an appearance structure
(see <a href="Appearances.html#Appearances">Appearances</a>).  Briefly, one provides a texture image
(see <a href="image.html#image">Image objects</a>), which is considered to lie in a square
in <code>(s,t)</code> parameter space in the range 0 &lt;= s &lt;= 1, 0 &lt;= t &lt;= 1. 
Then one provides a geometric primitive, with each vertex tagged with
<code>(s,t)</code> texture coordinates.  If texturing is enabled, the
appropriate portion of the texture image is pasted onto each face of the
textured object.

   <p>There is (currently) no provision for inheritance of part of a texture
structure; if the <code>texture</code> keyword is mentioned in an appearance,
it supplants any other texture specification.

   <p>The appearance attribute <code>texturing</code> controls whether textures are
used; there's no performance penalty for having texture { <small class="dots">...</small> } fields
defined when texturing is off.

   <p>The available fields are:

<pre class="example">     clamp   none  -or-  s  -or-  t  -or-  st
       Determines the meaning of texture coordinates outside the range 0..1.
       With <code>clamp none</code>, the default, coordinates are interpreted
       modulo 1, so (s,t) = (1.25,0), (.25,0), and (-.75,0) all refer to
       the same point in texture space.  With <code>s</code> or <code>t</code> or
       <code>st</code>, either or both of s- or t-coordinates less than 0 or
       greater than 1 are clamped to 1 or 0, respectively.
     
     image { &lt;image specification&gt; (see <a href="image.html#image">Image objects</a>) }
       Specify the actual texture image. Images can have 1, 2, 3 or 4 channels:
         1 channel:  luminance
         2 channels: luminance and alpha
         3 channels: RGB data
         4 channels: RGBA data
     
       See <a href="image.html#image">Image objects</a>, for the actual definition of image
       objects. The alpha-channel is only interpreted as mask: where the mask
       is zero, pixels are simply not drawn. An exception is the case where
       <em>apply</em> is equal to <em>modulate</em> and translucency is enabled:
       in this case the resulting alpha value is the result of the
       multiplication of the surface color with the alpha value of the
       texture's alpha channel.
     
     file      filename
     alphafile filename
       <em>This is considered obsolete, and only kept for compatibility,
       the modern way is to use the new OOGL image object. See <a href="image.html#image">Image objects</a>.
       The stuff documented here should still work, though</em>
     
       Specifies image file(s) containing the texture.
     
       The <em>file</em> keyword specifies a file with color or lightness information;
       <em>alphafile</em> if present, specifies a transparency ("alpha") mask;
       where the mask is zero, pixels are simply not drawn.
       Several image file formats are available; the file type must be
       indicated by the last few characters of the file name:
         .ppm or .ppm.Z or .ppm.gz  24-bit 3-color image in PPM format
         .pgm or .pgm.Z or .pgm.gz  8-bit grayscale image in PGM format
         .sgi or .sgi.Z or .sgi.gz  8-bit, 24-bit, or 32-bit SGI image
         .tiff                      8-bit or 24-bit TIFF image
         .gif                       GIF image
       For this feature to work, some programs must be available in
       geomview's search path:
         zcat  for .Z files
         gzip  for .gz files
         tifftopnm for .tiff files
         giftoppm for .gif files
     
       If an <code>alphafile</code> image is supplied, it must be the same size
       as the <code>file</code> image.
     
       <em>Image objects provide a more flexible way to specify texture
       data. See <a href="image.html#image">Image objects</a>.</em>
     
     apply   modulate  -or-  blend  -or-  decal
       Indicates how the texture image is applied to the surface.
       Here the "surface color" means the color the surface would have
       in the absence of texture mapping.
     
       With <code>modulate</code>, the default, the texture color (or lightness,
       if textured by a gray-scale image) is multiplied by the surface color.
     
       With <code>blend</code>, texture blends between the <code>background</code> color
       and the surface color.  The <code>file</code> parameter must specify a
       gray-scale image.  Where the texture image is 0, the surface color is
       unaffected; where it's 1, the surface is painted in the color given
       by <code>background</code>; and color is interpolated for intermediate values.
     
       With <code>decal</code>, the <code>file</code> parameter must specify a
       3-color image.  If an <code>alphafile</code> parameter is present,
       its value interpolates between the surface color (where alpha=0)
       and the texture color (where alpha=1).  Lighting does not affect the
       texture color in <code>decal</code> mode; effectively the texture is
       constant-shaded.
     
     background  R G B A
       Specifies a 4-component color, with R, G, B, and A floating-point
       numbers normally in the range 0..1, used when <code>apply blend</code>
       is selected.
     
     transform <code>transformation-matrix</code>
       Expects a list of 16 numbers, or one of the other ways of representing
       a transformation (<code>: handlename</code> or <code>&lt; filename</code>).
       The 4x4 transformation matrix is applied to texture coordinates,
       in the sense of a 4-component row vector (s,t,0,1) multiplied on
       the left of the matrix, to produce new coordinates (s',t')
       which actually index the texture.
