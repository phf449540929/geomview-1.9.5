<h3 class="section">6.5 Example 3: External Module with Bi-Directional Communication</h3>

<p>The previous two example modules simply send commands to Geomview and do
not receive anything from Geomview.  This section describes a module
that communicates in both directions.  There are two types of
communication that can go from Geomview to an external module.  This
example shows <em>asynchronous</em> communication &mdash; the module needs to
be able to respond at any moment to expressions that Geomview may emit
which inform the module of some change of state within Geomview.

   <p>(The other type of communication is <em>synchronous</em>, where a module
sends a request to Geomview for some piece of information and waits for
a response to come back before doing anything else.  The main GCL
command for requesting information of this type is
<a href="write.html#write"><code>(write ...)</code></a>.  This module does not do any synchronous
communication.)

   <p>In ansynchronous communication, Geomview sends expressions that are
essentially echoes of GCL commands.  The external module sends
Geomview a command expressing interest in a certain command, and then
every time Geomview executes that command, the module receives a copy of
it.  This happens regardless of who sent the command to Geomview; it can
be the result of the user doing something with a Geomview panel, or
it may have come from another module or from a file that Geomview reads. 
This is how a module can find out about and act on things that happen in
Geomview.

   <p>This example uses the OOGL lisp library to parse and act on the
expressions that Geomview writes to the module's standard input.  This
library is actually part of Geomview itself &mdash; we wrote the library in
the process of implementing GCL.  It is also convenient to use it in
external modules that must understand a of subset of GCL &mdash;
specifically, those commands that the module has expressed interest in.

   <p>This example shows how a module can receive user pick events, i.e. 
when the user clicks the right mouse button with the cursor over a geom
in a Geomview camera window.  When this happens Geomview generates an
internal call to a procedure called <code>pick</code>; the arguments to the
procedure give information about the pick, such as what object was
picked, the coordinates of the picked point, etc.  If an external module
has expressed interest in calls to <code>pick</code>, then whenever
<code>pick</code> is called Geomview will echo the call to the module's
standard input.  The module can then do whatever it wants with the pick
information.

   <p>This module is the same as the <em>Nose</em> module that comes with
Geomview.  Its purpose is to illustrate picking.  Whenever you pick on a
geom by clicking the right mouse button on it, the module draws a little
box at the spot where you clicked.  Usually the box is yellow.  If you
pick a vertex, the box is colored magenta.  If you pick a point on an
edge of an object, the module will also highlight the edge by drawing
cyan boxes at its endpoints and drawing a yellow line along the edge.

   <p>Note that in order for this module to actually do anything you must have
a geom loaded into Geomview and you must click the right mouse button
with the cursor over a part of the geom.

</pre>
   <p>The code begins by defining procedures <code>progn()</code> and
<code>endprogn()</code> which begin and end a Geomview <code>progn</code> group. 
The purpose of the Geomview <code>progn</code> command is to group commands
together and cause Geomview to execute them all at once, without
refreshing any graphics windows until the end.  It is a good idea to
group blocks of commands that a module sends to Geomview like this so
that the user sees their cumulative effect all at once.

   <p>Procedure <code>Initialize()</code> does various things needed at program
startup time.  It initializes the lisp library by calling
<code>LInit()</code>.  Any program that uses the lisp library should call this
once before calling any other lisp library functions.  It then calls
<code>LDefun</code> to tell the library about our <code>pick</code> procedure, which
is defined further down with a call to the <code>PICKFUNC</code> macro.  Then
it sends a bunch of setup commands to Geomview, grouped in a
<code>progn</code> block.  This includes defining a handle called
<code>littlebox</code> that stores the geometry of the little box.  Next it
sends the command

<pre class="example">     (interest (pick world * * * * nil nil nil nil nil))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">which tells Geomview to notify us when a pick event happens.

   <p>The syntax of this <code>interest</code> statement merits some explanation. 
In general <code>interest</code> takes one argument which is a (parenthesized)
expression representing a Geomview function call.  It specifies a type
of call that the module is interested in knowing about.  The arguments
can be any particular argument values, or the special symbols <code>*</code>
or <code>nil</code>.  For example, the first argument in the <code>pick</code>
expression above is <code>world</code>.  This means that the module is
interested in calls to <code>pick</code> where the first argument, which
specifies the coordinate system, is <code>world</code>.  A <code>*</code> is like a
wild-card; it means that the module is interested in calls where the
corresponding argument has any value.  The word <code>nil</code> is like
<code>*</code>, except that the argument's value is not reported to the
module.  This is useful for cutting down on the amount of data that must
be transmitted in cases where there are arguments that the module
doesn't care about.

   <p>The second, third, fourth, and fifth arguments to the <code>pick</code>
command give the name, pick point coordinates, vertex coordinates, and
edge coordinates of a pick event.  We specify these by <code>*</code>'s above. 
The remaining five arguments to the <code>pick</code> command give other
information about the pick event that we do not care about in this
module, so we specify these with <code>nil</code>'s.  For the details of the
arguments to <code>pick</code>, See <a href="GCL.html#GCL">GCL</a>.

   <p>The <code>geometry</code> statement defines a geom called <code>pick</code> that is
initially an empty list, specified as <code> { LIST } </code>; this is the
best way of specifying a null geom.  The module will replace this with
something useful by sending Geomview another <code>geometry</code> command
when the user picks something.  Next we arrange for the <code>pick</code>
object to be non-pickable, and turn normalization off for it so that
Geomview will display it in the size and location where we put it,
rather than resizing and relocating it to fit into the unit cube.

   <p>The next function in the file, <code>Lpick</code>, is defined with a strange
looking call to a macro called <code>PICKFUNC</code>, defined in the header
file <samp><span class="file">pickfunc.h</span></samp>.  This is the function for handling pick events. 
The reason we provide a macro for this is that that macro encapsulates a
lot of necessary stuff that would be the same for the pick-handling
function in any program.  If you write a Geomview module that wants to
know about user pick events you can just copy this macro call and change
it to suit yours needs.

   <p>In general the syntax for <code>PICKFUNC</code> is
<pre class="example">     PICKFUNC(<var>name</var>, <var>block</var>, <var>NDblock</var>)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where <var>name</var> is the name of the procedure to be defined, in this
case <code>Lpick</code>. The next argument, <var>block</var>, is a block of code to
be executed when a pick event occurs.  If <var>block</var> contains a return
statement, then the returned value must be a pointer to a Lisp-object,
that is of type <code>LObject *</code>. The last argument has the same
functionality as the <var>block</var> argument, but is only invoked when
picking objects in a higher dimensional world.

   <p><code>PICKFUNC</code> declares certain local variables in the body of the
procedure. When the module receives a <code>(pick ...)</code> statement
from Geomview, the procedure assigns values to these variables based on
the information in the <code>pick</code> call (variables corresponding to
<code>nil</code>'s in the <code>(interest (pick ...))</code> are not given
values).

   <p>There is also a second variant of the <code>PICKFUNC</code> macro with a
slightly different syntax:
<pre class="example">     DEFPICKFUNC(<var>helpstr</var>, <var>coordsys</var>, <var>id</var>,
       <var>point</var>, <var>pn</var>, <var>vertex</var>, <var>vn</var>, <var>edge</var>, <var>en</var>, <var>face</var>, <var>fn</var>, <var>ppath</var>, <var>ppn</var>,
       <var>vi</var>, <var>ei</var>, <var>ein</var>, <var>fi</var>,
       <var>body</var>, <var>NDbody</var>)
</pre>
   <p><code>DEFPICKFUNC</code> can be used as well as <code>PICKFUNC</code>, there is no
functional difference with the exception that the name of the C-function
is tied to <code>Lpick</code> when using <code>DEFPICKFUNC</code> and that the
<code>(help pick)</code> GCL-command (see <a href="help.html#help"><code>(help ...)</code></a>)
would respond with echoing <var>helpstr</var>.

   <p>The table below lists all variables defined in <code>PICKFUNC</code> In the
context of ND-viewing <code>float</code> variants of the arguments apply: the
<var>body</var> execution block sees the <code>HPoint3</code> variables, and the
<var>NDbody</var> block sees only flat one-dimensional arrays of
<code>float</code>-type.

   <p>In the ND-viewing context the co-ordinates passed to the pick function
are still the 3-dimensional co-ordinates of the camera view-port where
the pick occurred, but padded with zeroes on transformed back to the
co-ordinate system specified by the second argument of the <code>pick</code>
command.

     <dl>
<dt><code>char *coordsys;</code><dd>A string specifying the coordinate system in which coordinates are
given.  In this example, this will always be <code>world</code> because
of the <code>interest</code> call above.

     <br><dt><code>char *id;</code><dd>A string specifying the name of the picked geom.

     <br><dt><code>HPoint3 point; int pn;</code>
<br><dt><code>float *point; int pn;</code><dd><code>point</code> is an <code>HPoint3</code> structure giving the coordinates of
the picked point.  <code>HPoint3</code> is a homogeneous point coordinate
representation equivalent to an array of 4 floats. <code>pn</code> tells how
many coordinates have been written into this array; it will always be
either <code>0</code>, <code>4</code> or greater than <code>4</code>. If it is greater
than <code>4</code>, then the <var>NDbody</var> instruction block is invoked and in
this case <code>point</code> is a flat array of <code>pn</code> many <code>float</code>s. 
A value of zero means no point was picked, i.e. the user clicked the
right mouse button while the cursor was not pointing at a geom. In this
case the ordinary <var>block</var> 3d instruction block is executed.

     <br><dt><code>HPoint3 vertex; int vn;</code>
<br><dt><code>float *vertex; int vn;</code><dd><code>vertex</code> is an <code>HPoint3</code> structure giving the coordinates of
the picked vertex, if the pick point was near a vertex.  <code>vn</code> tells
how many coordinates have been written into this array; it will always
be either <code>0</code> or greater equal <code>4</code>. A value of zero means the
pick point was not near a vertex. In the context of ND-viewing
<code>vertex</code> will be an array of <code>vn</code> <code>float</code>s and <code>vn</code>
will be equal to <code>pn</code>.

     <br><dt><code>HPoint3 edge[2]; int en;</code>
<br><dt><code>float *edge; int en;</code><dd><code>edge</code> is an array of two <code>HPoint3</code> structures giving the
coordinates of the endpoints of the picked edge, if the pick point was
near an edge.  <code>en</code> tells how many coordinates have been written
into this array; it will always be <code>0</code> or greater equal <code>8</code>. 
A value of zero means the pick point was not near an edge. In the
context of ND-viewing <code>edge</code> will be a flat one-dimensional array
of <code>en</code> many <code>float</code>s: the first <code>pn</code> <code>float</code>s
define the first vertex, and the second <code>pn</code> many <code>float</code>s
define the second vertex; <code>en</code> will be two times <code>pn</code>.

   </dl>

   <p>In this example module, the remaining variables will never be given
values because their values in the <code>interest</code> statement were
specified as <code>nil</code>.

     <dl>
<dt><code>HPoint3 face[]; int fn;</code>
<br><dt><code>float *face; int fn;</code><dd><code>face</code> is a variable length array of <var>fn</var> <code>HPoint3</code>'s. 
<code>face</code> gives the coordinates of the vertices of the picked face. 
<code>fn</code> tells how many coordinates have been written into this array;
it will always be either <code>0</code> or a multiple of <code>pn</code>. A value of
zero means the pick point was not near a face. In the context of
ND-viewing <code>face</code> is a flat one-dimensional array of <code>fn</code> many
floats of which each vertex occupies <code>pn</code> many components.

     <br><dt><code>int ppath[]; int ppn;</code><dd><code>ppath</code> is an array of <var>maxpathlen</var> <code>int</code>'s.  <code>ppath</code>
gives the path through the OOGL heirarchy to the picked primitive. 
<code>pn</code> tells how many integers have been written into this array; it
will be at most <var>maxpathlen</var>.  A path of {3,1,2}, for example,
means that the picked primitive is "subobject number 2 of subobject
number 1 of object 3 in the world".

     <br><dt><code>int vi;</code><dd><code>vi</code> gives the index of the picked vertex in the picked primitive,
if the pick point was near a vertex.

     <br><dt><code>int ei[2]; int ein</code><dd>The <code>ei</code> array gives the indices of the endpoints of the picked
edge, if the pick point was near a vertex.  <code>ein</code> tells how many
integers were written into this array.  It will always be either 0 or 2;
a value of 0 means the pick point was not near an edge.

     <br><dt><code>int fi;</code><dd><code>fi</code> gives the index of the picked face in the picked primitive, if
the pick point was near a face.

   </dl>

   <p>The <code>handle_pick</code> procedure actually does the work of dealing with
the pick event.  It begins by normalizing the homogeneous coordinates
passed in as arguments so that we can assume the fourth coordinate is 1. 
It then sends GCL commands to define the <code>pick</code> object to be
whatever is appropriate for the kind of pick recieved.  See see <a href="OOGL-File-Formats.html#OOGL-File-Formats">OOGL File Formats</a>, and see <a href="GCL.html#GCL">GCL</a>, for an explanation of the
format of the data in these commands.

   <p>The main program, at the bottom of the file, first calls
<code>Initialize()</code>.  Next, the call to <code>LakeDefine</code> defines the
<code>Lake</code> that the lisp library will use.  A <code>Lake</code> is a
structure that the lisp library uses internally as a type of
communiation vehicle.  (It is like a unix stream but more general, hence
the name.)  This call to <code>LakeDefine</code> defines a <code>Lake</code>
structure for doing I/O with <code>stdin</code> and <code>stdout</code>.  The third
argument to <code>LakeDefine</code> should be <code>NULL</code> for external modules
(it is used by Geomview).  Finally, the program enters its main loop
which parses and evaluates expressions from standard input.
