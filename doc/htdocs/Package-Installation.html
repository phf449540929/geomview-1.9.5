<h3 class="section">9.6 Installing the Mathematica Packages</h3>

<blockquote>
<b>BUG:</b> This section is out of date. <code>Geomview</code> follows the
GNU-installation habits, data goes to <samp><span class="file">PREFIX/share/geomview/</span></samp>,
user executables to <samp><span class="file">PREFIX/bin/</span></samp>, private executables to
<samp><span class="file">PREFIX/libexec/geomview/</span></samp>, libraries to <samp><span class="file">PREFIX/lib/</span></samp> where
<code>PREFIX</code> denotes the installation prefiex specified for the
<samp><span class="file">TOPSRCDIR/configure</span></samp> script. Please have a look at the files
<samp><span class="file">TOPSRCDIR/INSTALL</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">TOPSRCDIR/INSTALL.Geomview</span></samp> for
installation instructions.

   <p>The installed Mathematica data-files can be found in
<samp><span class="file">PREFIX/share/geomview/Mathematica/</span></samp>. 
</blockquote>

   <p>If Geomview is properly installed on your system according to the
instructions in See <a href="Installation.html#Installation">Installation</a>, then the Mathematica-to-Geomview
packages should work as described here; there should be no need for
additional installation procedures.  In practice, however, it is
sometimes necessary to taylor the installation of the Mathematica
packages and/or of Geomview itself to suit the needs of a particular
system.  This section contains details about how the installation works;
if the Mathematica-to-Geomview connection does not seem to work for you
after following the Geomview installation procedure, consult this
section to see what might need to be fixed.

   <p>In this section, the phrase <em>Geomview installation</em> refers any of
the procedures in See <a href="Installation.html#Installation">Installation</a>.  The way the Mathematica packages
work and are installed is the same regardless of whether you have
one of the binary distributions or the source distribution.

     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <li>The relevant mathematica files are <samp><span class="file">OOGL.m</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">Geomview.m</span></samp>, and
<samp><span class="file">BezierPlot.m</span></samp>; Mathematica must be able to find these files.  They
are distributed in the <samp><span class="file">PREFIX/share/geomview/Mathematica</span></samp>
subdirectory of the binary distributions, and in the
<samp><span class="file">TOPSRCDIR/src/bin/geomutil/math2oogl</span></samp> subdirectory of the source
distribution.  These files need to be in a directory that is on
Mathematica's search path.  You can look at the value of the
<code>$Path</code> variable in a Mathematica session on your system to see a
list of the directories on Mathematica's search path.

     <p>The Geomview installation procedure puts copies of the Mathematica
packages into a directory that you specify (<code>MMAPACKAGEDIR</code>).  This
should ensure that Mathematica can find them.  Alternately, you could
arrange to append the pathname of the Mathmematica package subdirectory
of the Geomview distribution to the <code>$Path</code> variable each time you
run Mathematica.

     <li>The package <samp><span class="file">OOGL.m</span></samp> needs to be able to invoke the programs
<samp><span class="file">geomview</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">math2oogl</span></samp>, and <samp><span class="file">oogl2rib</span></samp>.  The Geomview
installation procedure installs these programs into a directory that you
specify for executables (<code>BINDIR</code>).  Ideally, this directory should
be on your shell's <code>$PATH</code>.  More specifically, it should be on
the <code>$PATH</code> of the shell in which Mathematica runs; the directory
<samp><span class="file">/usr/local/bin</span></samp> is usually a good choice.  You can see the list of
directories on this path by giving the command <code>!echo $path</code> in
Mathematica.

     <p>If for some reason you can't arrange for <samp><span class="file">geomview</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="file">math2oogl</span></samp>, and <samp><span class="file">oogl2rib</span></samp> to be in a directory on the
shell's <code>$path</code>, you can modify <samp><span class="file">OOGL.m</span></samp> to cause it to look
for them using absolute pathnames.  To do this, change the definitions
of the variables <code>$GeomviewPath</code> and <code>$GeomRoot</code>, which are
defined near the top of the file.  Change <code>$GeomviewPath</code> to the
absolute pathname of the <samp><span class="file">geomview</span></samp> shell script on your system. 
Change <code>$GeomRoot</code> to the absolute pathname of the
<samp><span class="file">$GEOMROOT</span></samp> directory on your system.  If you do this, you should
also make sure there are copies of <samp><span class="file">geomview</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">math2oogl</span></samp>,
and <samp><span class="file">oogl2ri</span></samp>b in the <samp><span class="file">$GEOMROOT/bin/&lt;CPU&gt;</span></samp>.

     <li>The <samp><span class="file">geomview</span></samp> shell script, which <samp><span class="file">OOGL.m</span></samp> uses to invoke
Geomview, needs to be able to find the geomview executable file (
called <samp><span class="file">gvx</span></samp>). 
The Geomview installation procedure should have been taken care
of this, but if your Mathematica session doesn't seem to be able to
invoke Geomview, it's worth double-checking that the settings in the
<samp><span class="file">geomview</span></samp> script are correct.
