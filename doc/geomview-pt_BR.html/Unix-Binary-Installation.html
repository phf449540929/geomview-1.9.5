<h3 class="section">10.1 Instalando os Bin&aacute;rios Unix</h3>

<blockquote>
<b>BUG:</b> This section is out of date. <code>Geomview</code> follows the
GNU-installation habits, data goes to <samp><span class="file">PREFIX/share/geomview/</span></samp>,
user executables to <samp><span class="file">PREFIX/bin/</span></samp>, private executables to
<samp><span class="file">PREFIX/libexec/geomview/</span></samp>, libraries to <samp><span class="file">PREFIX/lib/</span></samp> where
<code>PREFIX</code> denotes the installation prefiex specified for the
<samp><span class="file">TOPSRCDIR/configure</span></samp> script. Please have a look at the files
<samp><span class="file">TOPSRCDIR/INSTALL</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">TOPSRCDIR/INSTALL.Geomview</span></samp> for
installation instructions. 
</blockquote>

   <p>If you have just obtained a copy da binary distribution
for a Unix system (Linux, SGI, Solaris, HP, etc),
you should be able to run Geomview and make
use of most of its features immediately after unpacking it by
<code>cd</code>'ing to the directory that it is in and typing <code>geomview</code>.

   <p>In order to fully install Geomview so that you can run it from any
directory and use all of its features, follow the steps in this section. 
In particular, you must go through this installation procedure in order
to use Geomview to display Mathematica graphics.

   <p>Geomview is distributed in a directory that contains various files and
subdirectories that Geomview needs at run-time, such as data files and
external modules.  It also contains other things distributed with
Geomview, such as documentation and (in the soure-code distribution)
source-code.  We refer to the root directory of this tree as the
<samp><span class="file">$GEOMROOT</span></samp> directory.  This is the directory called <samp><span class="file">Geomview</span></samp>
that is created when you unpack the distribution file.

   <p>To install Geomview on your system, arrange for the <samp><span class="file">$GEOMROOT</span></samp>
directory to be in a permanent place.  Then, in a shell janela,
<code>cd</code> to that directory and type <code>install</code>.  This runs a shell
script which does the installation after asking you several questions
about where you want to install the various componentes of Geomview.

   <p>After running the <code>install</code> script you should now be able to run
Geomview from any directory on your system.  (You may need to give the
<code>rehash</code> command in any shells on your computer that were started
up before you did the installation.)

   <p>The <samp><span class="file">install</span></samp> script puts copies dos files in
<samp><span class="file">$GEOMROOT/bin/&lt;CPU&gt;</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">$GEOMROOT/man</span></samp> into the directories
you specified for executables and man pages, respectively.  Once you
have done the installation you can cut down one the disk space required
by Geomview by removing some files from these directories, since copies
have been installed elsewhere.  You should first test that your
installed Geomview works properly because once you remove these files
from their distribution directories you will not be able to do the
installation again.

   <p>In particular, the files you can remove are

     <dl>
<dt><samp><span class="file">$GEOMROOT/bin/&lt;MACHTYPE&gt;</span></samp>:<dd>(where <samp><span class="file">&lt;MACHTYPE&gt;</span></samp> is the type of system you are on, e.g. 
<samp><span class="file">linux</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">sgi</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">hpux</span></samp>, etc). 
Remove all files from here except <samp><span class="file">gvx</span></samp>, which is the geomview
executable file.  DO NOT REMOVE <samp><span class="file">gvx</span></samp>.  It is not installed
elsewhere.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="file">$GEOMROOT/man</span></samp>:<dd>You can remove all the files in this directory.
