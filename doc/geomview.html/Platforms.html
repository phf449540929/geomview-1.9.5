<h2 class="unnumbered">Supported Platforms</h2>

<p>Geomview 1.9 should &ndash; in principle &ndash; compile and run on any fairly
recent Unix-like operating system. Specifically, it runs on Linux and on
Cygwin (Cygwin emulates a SystemV Unix-like environment under Microsoft
Windows). Unluckily Geomview compiles with MacOS X (Darwin), but
seemingly communicating with Geomview by means of pipes and sockets
cause segmentation faults. Feel free to fix that! See <a href="Contributing.html#Contributing">Contributing</a>,
for details.

<!-- Geomview runs on a wide variety of Unix systems. It has been tested on -->
<!-- each of the following systems: Linux, FreeBSD, SGI, Sun either (Sun-OS -->
<!-- 4.1.x and Solaris), HP RISC, Dec Alpha, RS/6000, and NeXT.  Precompiled -->
<!-- distributions are available for all of these systems.  Using either -->
<!-- OpenGL or the generic X11 renderer it can probably be compiled on other -->
<!-- Unix systems as well. -->
<!-- There is not a version of Geomview for Microsoft Windows.  The main -->
<!-- reason for this is that at the time when Geomview was written, personal -->
<!-- computers were not fast enough to make interactive 3D graphics feasible, -->
<!-- and by the time fast-enough PCs came around, the Geometry Center, -->
<!-- where Geomview was developed, was in the process of being closed.  The -->
<!-- staff started work on a port to Windows but was not able to finish it -->
<!-- before the Center shut down. -->
<!-- If you would like to see a version of Geomview for Windows, -->
<!-- you can contribute to its development in several ways. -->
<!-- @xref{Contributing}, for details. -->
<!-- There is also no version of Geomview for Macintosh. -->
