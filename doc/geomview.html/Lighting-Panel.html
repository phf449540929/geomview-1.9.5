<h4 class="subsection">3.6.3 The Lighting Panel</h4>

<p>The <em>Lights</em> panel controls the number, position, and color of
the light sources used in shading. 
<div class="float">

   <p><strong class="float-caption">The Lighting Panel.</strong></p></div>

   <p>The <em>Lighting</em> panel is different from the <em>Appearance</em> and
<em>Material</em> panels in that it always works with the base
appearance.  This is because it usually makes sense to use the same set
of lights for drawing all objects in your scene.

     <dl>
<dt><em>LIGHTS</em><dd>The <em>LIGHTS</em> browser shows the currently selected light.  Changes
made using the other widgets on this panel apply to this light.  There
is always at least one light, the ambient light.

     <br><dt><em>Intensity</em><dd>This slider controls the intensity of the current light.

     <br><dt><em>Color</em><dd>This button brings up a color chooser which lets you select the color
of the current light.

     <br><dt><em>Add</em><dd>This button adds a light.

     <br><dt><em>Delete</em><dd>This button deletes the current light.

     <br><dt><em>Show Lights</em><dd>This button lets you see and change the positions of the light sources
in a camera window.  Each light is drawn as long cylinder which is
supposed to remind you of a light beam.  When you click on the
<em>Show Lights</em> button Geomview goes into "light edit" mode, during
which you can rotate current light by holding down the left mouse button
and moving the mouse.  Lights placed in this way are infinitely distant,
so what you are changing is the angular position.  Click on the
<em>Show Lights</em> button again to return to the previous motion mode
and to quit drawing the light beams.

     <br><dt><em>Done</em><dd>This button dismisses the <em>Lighting</em> panel.

   </dl>

   <p>Geomview's <em>Appearance</em>, <em>Materials</em>, and <em>Lighting</em>
panels are constructed to allow you to easily do most of the appearance
related things that you might want to do.  The appearance hierarchy that
Geomview supports internally, however, is very complex and there are
certain operations that you cannot do with the panels.  The Geomview
command language (GCL) provides complete support for appearance
operations.  In particular, the <code>merge-baseap</code> command can be used
to change the base appearance (which, except for lighting, cannot be
changed by Geomview's panels).  The <code>merge-ap</code> command can be used
to change an individual geom's appearance.  Appearances can also be
specified in OOGL files; for details,
see <a href="Appearances.html#Appearances">Appearances</a>. See <a href="merge_002dbaseap.html#merge_002dbaseap"><code>(merge-baseap ...)</code></a>. See <a href="merge_002dap.html#merge_002dap"><code>(merge-ap ...)</code></a>.
