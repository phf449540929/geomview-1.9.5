<h2 class="unnumbered">History of Geomview's Development</h2>

<p>Geomview was originally written at the Geometry Center at the University
of Minnesota in Minneapolis. 
The Geometry Center was a research and education center
funded by the National Science Foundation, with a mission to promote
research and communication of mathematics.  Much of the work there
involved the use of computers to help visualize mathematical concepts.

   <p>The project that eventually led to Geomview
began in the summer of 1988 with the work of Pat
Hanrahan on a viewing program called MinneView.  Shortly
thereafter Charlie Gunn begin developing OOGL
(Object Oriented Graphics Language) in conjunction with
MinneView.  Many people contributed to OOGL and MinneView,
including Stuart Levy, Mark Meuer, Tamara Munzner, Steve
Anderson, Mario Lopez, Todd Kaplan.

   <p>In 1991 the staff of the Geometry Center began work on a new improved
version of OOGL, and a new and improved viewing program, which they
called Geomview.  At that time essentially the only game in town for
interactive 3D graphics was Silicon Graphics (SGI), so Geomview was
developed initially on SGI workstations, using IRIS GL.  The first
version was finished in January of 1992.  It immediately became very
popular among visitors to the Geometry Center, and through the Center's
ftp archive (this was before the web) people at other institutions began
using it too.

   <p>In addition to SGI workstations the Geometry Center had
quite a few NeXT stations, so soon after Geomview was running
on SGIs the staff developed a version for NeXTStep as well. 
By this time there were several thousand people using it
around the world.

   <p>A few years later the staff ported Geomview to X windows and OpenGL, and
eventually, with the demise of NeXT, the NeXT version fell by the
wayside.

   <p>In its mission to foster communication among researchers and educators,
the Geometry Center developed a web site, www.geom.umn.edu, in late
1993.  It was one of the first 300 web sites in existence.  A part of
the web site was of course devoted to Geomview, and helped to spread the
word about its existence.

   <p>The Geometry Center closed its "brick and mortar" facilities in August
of 1998 (NSF cut its funding), but the web site continued to exist, and
Geomview continued to be very popular around the world.  In December of
1999 some of the former Geometry Center staff set up
<a href="http://www.geomview.org">http://www.geomview.org</a> as a permanent home on the web for
Geomview.

   <p>Geomview's original authors, as well as a number of other volunteers
around the world, are still actively involved in using and developing
Geomview.
