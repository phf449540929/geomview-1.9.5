<h4 class="subsection">3.5.1 Selecting a Point of Interest</h4>

<p>It is sometimes useful to specify a particular point on some object in a
geomview window as the center point for mouse motions.  You can do this
by shift-clicking the right mouse button (i.e. click it once
while holding down the shift key on the keyboard) with the cursor over
the desired point.  This point then becomes the <em>point of
interest</em>.  The point of interest must be on an existing object.

   <p>Selecting a point of interest simplifies examining a small portion of a
larger object.  Shift-right-click on an interesting point, and select
<em>Orbit</em> mode.  Use the middle mouse button to approach, and the
left mouse to orbit the point, examining the region from different
directions.

   <p>When you have selected a point of interest, the current center object
changes to an object named "CENTER", which is an invisible object
located at the point of interest.  In addition, mouse motions for the
window in which you made the selection are adjusted so that the point of
interest follows the mouse.

   <p>You can change the point of interest at any time by selecting a new one
by shift-clicking the right mouse button again.  You can cancel
the point of interest altogether by shift-clicking the right
mouse button with the cursor on the background (i.e. not on any object). 
This changes the center object back to its default value, "target".

   <p>The object named "CENTER", which serves as the center object for the
point of interest, is a special kind of geom called an "alien".  It does
not appear in the <em>Targets</em> browser.  By default it has no geometry
associated with it and hence is invisible.  You can, however, explicitly
give it some geometry using a GCL command, causing it to appear.  Use
the <code>geometry</code> command for this: <code>(geometry CENTER
</code><var>geometry</var><code>)</code>, where <var>geometry</var> is any valid geometry.  For
example, <code>(geometry CENTER { &lt; xyz.vect })</code> causes the file
<samp><span class="file">xyz.vect</span></samp>, which is one of the standard example files distributed
with geomview, to be used at the geometry for CENTER. See <a href="geometry.html#geometry"><code>(geometry ...)</code></a>.

   <p>What happens internally when you select a point of interest is
that the center is set to the object called CENTER, and that object is
positioned at the point of interest.  In addition, in order for mouse
motions to track the point of interest, the current camera's focal
length is set to be the distance from the camera to the point of
interest.  You can accomplish this via GCL with the following commands:
<pre class="example">     (if (real-id CENTER) nil (new-alien CENTER {}))
     (ui-center CENTER)
     (transform-set CENTER universe universe translate <var>x</var> <var>y</var> <var>z</var>)
     (merge camera <var>cam-id</var> { focus <var>d</var> })
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where <code>(</code><var>x</var><code>,</code><var>y</var><code>,</code><var>z</var><code>)</code> are the (universe) coordinates of
the point of interest, and <var>d</var> is the distance from that point to
the current camera, <var>cam-id</var>.  The first command above creates the
"alien" CENTER if it does not yet exist.
