<h3 class="section">3.6 Changing the Way Things Look</h3>

<p>Geomview uses a hierarchy of appearances to control the way things look. 
An <dfn>appearance</dfn> is a specification of information about how
something should be drawn.  This can include many things such things as
color, lighting, material properties, and more.  Appearances work in a
hierarchal manner: if a certain appearance property, for example face
color, is not specified in a particular object's appearance, that object
is drawn using that property from the parent appearance.  If both the
parent and the child appearance specify a property, the child's setting
takes precedence unless the parent appearance is set to override.

   <p>Every geom in Geomview has an appearance associated with it.  There is
also an appearance associated with the "World" geom, which serves as the
parent of each individual geom's appearance.  Finally, there is a
global "base" appearance, which is the parent of the World appearance.

   <p>The base appearance specifies reasonable values for all appearance
information, and by default none of the other appearances specify
anything, which means they inherit their values from the base
appearance.  This means that by default all objects are drawn using the
base appearance.

   <p>If you change a certain appearance property for a geom, that property
is used in drawing that geom.  The parent appearance is used for any
properties that you do not explicitly set.

   <p>Geomview has three panels which let you modify appearances.

<ul class="menu">
<li><a accesskey="1" href="Appearance-Panel.html#Appearance-Panel">Appearance Panel</a>:             Color etc. 
<li><a accesskey="2" href="Materials-Panel.html#Materials-Panel">Materials Panel</a>:              Surface Material properties. 
<li><a accesskey="3" href="Lighting-Panel.html#Lighting-Panel">Lighting Panel</a>:               Lighting Parameters. 
</ul>
