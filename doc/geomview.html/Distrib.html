<h2 class="unnumbered">Distribution</h2>

<p>Geomview is <dfn>free software</dfn>; this means that everyone is free to
use it and free to redistribute it on certain conditions. 
Geomview is
not in the public domain; it is copyrighted and there are restrictions
on its distribution, but these restrictions are designed to permit
everything that a good cooperating citizen would want to do.  What is
not allowed is to try to prevent others from further sharing any version
of Geomview that they might get from you.  The precise conditions are
found in the GNU Lesser Public License that comes with Geomview and also
appears following this section.

   <p>One way to get a copy of Geomview is from someone else who has it.  You
need not ask for our permission to do so, or tell any one else; just
copy it.  If you have access to the Internet, you can get the latest
distribution version of Geomview at <a href="http://www.geomview.org">http://www.geomview.org</a>.

   <p>You may also receive Geomview when you buy a computer.  Computer
manufacturers are free to distribute copies on the same terms that apply to
everyone else.  These terms require them to give you the full sources,
including whatever changes they may have made, and to permit you to
redistribute the Geomview received from them under the usual terms of the
General Public License.  In other words, the program must be free for you
when you get it, not just free for the manufacturer.
