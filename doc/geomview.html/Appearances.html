<h4 class="subsection">4.1.10 Appearances</h4>

<p>Geometric objects can have associated "appearance" information,
specifying shading, lighting, color, wire-frame vs. shaded-surface
display, and so on.  Appearances are inherited through object
hierarchies, e.g. attaching an appearance to a <code>LIST</code> means that the
appearance is applied to all the <code>LIST</code>'s members.

   <p>Some appearance-related properties are relegated to "material",
"lighting" and "texture" substructures. Take care to note which
properties belong to which structure. Any geometric object can be
preceded by an appearance definition like in the following example:

<pre class="example">     {
        appearance { +edge }
        LIST { &lt; "file1" } { QUAD 1 0 0  0 0 1  0 1 0  1 0 0 }
     }
</pre>
   <p>Appearances are also OOGL objects in their own right and can be given
symbolic names and referenced by them
(see <a href="References.html#References">References</a>). See <a href="appearance-objects.html#appearance-objects">Appearance objects</a>.

     <dl>
<dt><b>Texture Mapping</b><dd>There is a separate section concerning the definition of textures
(see <a href="Texture-Mapping.html#Texture-Mapping">Texture Mapping</a>).

     <br><dt><b>Transparency</b><dd>Rendering translucent objects is not supported by all drawing back
ends. The OpenGL renderer has limited support for it: top-level objects
(i.e. those which appear in the object browser of the main panel
(see <a href="Basic-Interaction.html#Basic-Interaction">The Main Panel</a>) are rendered correctly by
means of alpha-blending). Also, the RenderMan snapshots will include
opacity values. 
</dl>

   <p>Here's an example appearance structure including values for all
attributes.  Order of attributes is unimportant.  As usual, white space
is irrelevant.  Boolean attributes may be preceded by "+" or "-" to turn
them on or off; "+" is assumed if only the attribute name appears. 
Other attributes expect values.

   <p>A "*" prefix on any attribute, e.g. "*+edge" or "*linewidth 2"
or "material { *diffuse 1 1 .25 }", selects "override" status for
that attribute.

<pre class="example">     appearance {
       +face               # (Do) draw faces of polygons.  On by default.

   <p>There are rules for inheritance of appearance attributes when several
are imposed at different levels in the hierarchy.

   <p>For example, Geomview installs a backstop appearance which provides
default values for most parameters; its control panels install other
appearances which supply new values for a few attributes; user-supplied
geometry may also contain appearances.

   <p>The general rule is that the child's appearance (the one closest to the
geometric primitives) wins.  Further, appearance controls with
"override" status (e.g. <code>*+face or material { *diffuse 1 1 0 }</code>)
win over those without it.

   <p>Geomview's appearance controls use the "override" feature so as to be
effective even if user-supplied objects contain their own appearance settings. 
However, if a user-supplied object contains an appearance field with
override status set, that property will be immune to Geomview's controls.
