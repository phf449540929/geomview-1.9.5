<h3 class="section">6.3 Example 2: Simple External Module with FORMS Control Panel</h3>

<p>This section gives a new version of the above module &mdash; one that
includes a user interface panel for controlling the velocity of the
oscillation.  We use the FORMS library by Mark Overmars for the control
panel.  The FORMS library is a public domain user interface toolkit for
IRISes. <!-- For more information @xref{Forms}. -->

   <p>To try out this example, make a copy of the file
<samp><span class="file">example2.c</span></samp> (distributed with Geomview in the <samp><span class="file">doc</span></samp>
subdirectory) in your directory and compile it with the command

<pre class="example">     cc -I/u/gcg/ngrap/include -o example2 example2.c \
       -L/u/gcg/ngrap/lib/sgi -lforms -lfm_s -lgl_s -lm
</pre>
   <p>You should
replace the string <samp><span class="file">/u/gcg/ngrap</span></samp> above with the pathname of the
Geomview distribution directory on your system.  (The forms library is
distributed with Geomview and the <code>-I</code> and <code>-L</code> options above
tell the compiler where to find it.)

   <p>Then put the line

<pre class="example">     (emodule-define "Example 2" "./example2")
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">in a file called <samp><span class="file">.geomview</span></samp> in the current directory and invoke
Geomview from that directory.  Click on the "Example 2" entry in the
<em>Modules</em> browser to invoke the module.  A small control panel
should appear.  You can then control the velocity of the mesh
oscillation by moving the slider.

   <p>The code begins by including some header files needed for the event loop
and the FORMS library.  It then declares global variables for holding a
pointer to the slider FORMS object and the velocity <code>dt</code>.  These
are global because they are needed in the slider callback procedure
<code>SetVelocity</code>, which forms calls every time the user moves the
slider bar. <code>SetVelocity</code> sets <code>dt</code> to be the new value of the
slider.

   <p><code>Quit</code> is the callback procedure for the <em>Quit</em> button;
it provides a graceful way for the user to terminate the program.

   <p>The procedure <code>create_panel</code> calls a bunch of FORMS library
procedures to set up the control panel with slider and button.  For more
information on using FORMS to create interface panels see the FORMS
documentation.  In particular, FORMS comes with a graphical panel
designer that lets you design your panels interactively and generates
code like that in <code>create_panel</code>.

   <p>This example's main program is similar to the previous example, but
includes extra code to deal with setting up and managing the FORMS
panel.

   <p>To set up the panel we call the GL procedure <code>foreground</code> to cause
the process to run in the foreground.  By default GL programs run in the
background, and for various reasons external modules that use FORMS
(which is based on GL) need to run in the foreground.  We then call
<code>create_panel</code> to create the panel and <code>fl_set_slider_value</code>
to set the initial value of the slider.  The call to <code>fl_show_form</code>
causes the panel to appear on the screen.

   <p>The first three lines of the main loop, starting with
<pre class="example">     fdmask = (1 &lt;&lt; fileno(stdin)) | (1 &lt;&lt; qgetfd());
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">check for and deal with events in the panel.  The call to <code>select</code>
imposes a delay on each pass through the main loop.  This call returns
either after a delay of 1/5 second or when the next GL event occurs, or
when data appears on standard input, whichever comes first.  The
<code>timeout</code> variable specifies the amount of time to wait on this
call; the first member (0 in this example) gives the number of seconds,
and the second member (200000 in this example) gives the number of
microseconds.  Finally, <code>fl_check_forms()</code> checks for and processes
any FORMS events that have happened; in this case this means calling
<code>SetVelocity</code> if the user has moved the slider or calling
<code>Quit</code> if the user has clicked on the <em>Quit</em> button.

   <p>The purpose of the delay in the loop is to keep the program from using
excessive amounts of CPU time running around its main loop when there
are no events to be processed.  This is not so crucial in this example,
and in fact may actually slow down the animation somewhat, but in
general with external modules that have event loops it is important to
do something like this because otherwise the module will needlessly take
CPU cycles away from other running programs (such as Geomview!)  even
when it isn't doing anything.

   <p>The last line of the main loop in this example, the call to
<code>UpdateMesh</code>, is the same as in the previous example.
